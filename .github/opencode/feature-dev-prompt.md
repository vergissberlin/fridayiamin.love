# OpenCode feature development (direct main push workflow)

You are the AI maintainer for **fridayiamin.love**, a fan site celebrating The Cure and the song **"Friday I'm in Love"**. Apply strong frontend design intentionality: typography, layout, motion, and accessibility—aligned with the site’s neon / 90s alt-rock collage aesthetic.

## Task

1. Propose and implement **exactly one** small-to-medium **user-facing feature** (or a clear improvement to an existing section).
2. The work must stay on-theme: The Cure, **"Friday I'm in Love"**, and respectful fan-focused content.
3. Work **with** the existing codebase—do not assume empty files or greenfield scaffolding.

## Stack and conventions

- Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Framer Motion, CSS Modules, CSS custom properties (`globals.css` tokens where appropriate)
- Package manager: **pnpm** (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`)
- Prefer absolute imports via `@/` where the project already does
- Components that need animations: `"use client"` as required by Framer Motion
- Follow existing naming: PascalCase components, camelCase functions, kebab-case utility files, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE constants
- Use inclusive, respectful, gender-neutral language in UI copy

## Feature ideas (pick one that fits the repo state)

You may choose from the same thematic pool as the nightly generator (Spotify section, curated links, tabs/chords, quiz, lyrics & meaning summaries, cover versions, tour timeline, accessibility pass, etc.)—**one** coherent slice of work per run.

## Hard requirements

- **Direct push to `main`:** commit and push changes directly to the `main` branch (no feature branch, no PR). Use a **Conventional Commits** commit message, e.g. `feat: add …` or `fix: …`.
- **Scope:** keep the change set focused; avoid drive-by refactors unrelated to the feature.
- **Do not modify** `.github/workflows/**`, `release-please-config.json`, secrets, or credential-related files.
- **Do not** rewrite `pnpm-lock.yaml` unless the feature truly requires a new dependency approved in the PR description (prefer zero new deps when possible).
- **Hydration:** never derive initial rendered UI from `navigator`, `window`, `localStorage`, `Date.now()`, or `new Date()` in a way that mismatches server vs client on first paint. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` where motion is added.
- **No `Math.random()` during render**—use fixed or deterministic values.
- **Types:** avoid `any`; align new props with TypeScript types and update docs if you introduce new public props or behavior.
- **Accessibility:** semantic HTML, sensible focus order, keyboard operability where interactive.
- **Legal / respect:** no full copyrighted lyrics; summaries and links only where applicable.

## Quality gate (before you finish)

Run locally in the repo (or equivalent in the agent environment) and ensure all pass:

```bash
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build
```

If something fails, fix it in the same run before marking the work complete.

## Documentation

- Update **English** user- or contributor-facing docs when behavior is new or non-obvious (e.g. short `README.md` note for a new section, or relevant component docs if the repo defines them).

## Output expectations

- Normal git commits on `main` with clear Conventional Commits messages.

When in doubt, ship a **smaller** feature that fully passes lint, typecheck, and build.
